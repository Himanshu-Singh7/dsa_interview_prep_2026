We love contributions! To keep the code clean, please follow these steps:

### 1. The Workflow
1. **Fork** this repository.
2. **Create a Branch:** `git checkout -b feature/your-problem-name`
3. **Commit your changes:** `git commit -m 'Add: [Problem Name] solution'`
4. **Push to the branch:** `git push origin feature/your-problem-name`
5. **Open a Pull Request (PR)** against the `master` branch.

### 2. Code Standards
- Include **Time Complexity** and **Space Complexity** at the top of your file.
- Use meaningful variable names (e.g., `currNode` instead of `c`).
- Place your file in the correct folder (e.g., `Data_Structures/Arrays/`).

### 3. Review Process
- I will review all PRs within 24-48 hours.
- Once approved, your code will be merged into the main project!
